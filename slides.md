### Course learning Goals (cont.)
4. Parse complex data structures such as Python dictionaries and Pandas data frames;
5. Apply digital methodologies of various kinds to humanities related data;
6. Evaluate the methodologies and results of digital humanities projects.

### Special Collections at Tisch Library

#### In-Class Activity
Pick a book and answer the following questions. It is fine to pick a source you cannot read. You
may complete this exercise alone or with a partner. Be prepared to discuss your findings with
the class (time permitting).

1. Describe this source. When and where was it created? What language(s) does it use?
Who was the author? Are there other creators (for instance printers, translators,
illustrators) who can be identified?

2. What unique characteristics does the Tisch Library copy of this source have? Look at
binding, flyleaves, bookplate(s), etc. Did anyone write in the copy? Would it be important
to include these elements in a digital representation of this source? Why or why not?

3. Identify and briefly describe 3-5 “para-textual” elements in this source. How do each of
these elements aid (or hinder?) the reader from understanding the source? Would it be
important to include these elements in a digital representation of this source? Why or
why not?

 ### Assignment
 Students are given two options for the assignment:
 1. Take a photo of a page with paratextual elements and them encode the page using TEI
 2. Parse a chapter of Gibbon's text in TEI

### What Has Worked Well
- Students generally appreciate the opportunity to view and work with rare books.
- The specific items curated by special collections staff illustrates the material history of textual production in an effective way.
- Students come away from the session with an understanding of the importance of TEI in digital humanities projects.

### What can be Improved
- Asking students to transcribe a page of text in order to put it into TEI is a lot of work. 
- The session has been offered too late in the semester for students to apply what was learned here for their final projects.
